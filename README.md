# ValidationAndErrorContract

## Overview

The `ValidationAndErrorContract` is a simple smart contract written in Solidity that demonstrates basic validation and error handling mechanisms. The contract manages a fund balance, allowing users to add and withdraw funds with appropriate checks and balances.

## Features

- **Add Funds:** Users can add funds to the contract, ensuring the amount is greater than zero.
- **Take Funds:** Users can withdraw funds from the contract, ensuring the amount is greater than zero and sufficient funds are available.
- **Get Funds:** Users can view the total funds available in the contract.

## Functions

### 1. `addFunds(uint256 amount)`

Adds the specified amount to the total funds in the contract.

#### Parameters:
- `amount`: The amount to be added to the contract. Must be greater than zero.

#### Example:
```solidity
contract.addFunds(100);
2. takeFunds(uint256 amount)
Withdraws the specified amount from the total funds in the contract if sufficient funds are available.

Parameters:
amount: The amount to be withdrawn from the contract. Must be greater than zero and less than or equal to the total funds available.
Example:
solidity
Copy code
contract.takeFunds(50);
3. getFunds()
Returns the total funds available in the contract.

Returns:
uint256: The total funds available in the contract.
Example:
solidity
Copy code
uint256 funds = contract.getFunds();
Error Handling
require Statements: Used to ensure that the amount for adding or withdrawing funds is greater than zero.
revert Statement: Used to stop the transaction and revert changes if there are insufficient funds for withdrawal.
assert Statement: Used to ensure that the total funds are always non-negative.
Deployment
To deploy this contract, use the following code in your Solidity environment:

solidity
Copy code
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.18;

contract ValidationAndErrorContract {
    uint256 public totalFunds;

    constructor() {
        totalFunds = 0;
    }

    function addFunds(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "The amount to be added must be greater than zero");
        totalFunds += amount;
    }

    function takeFunds(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "The amount to be taken out must be greater than zero");

        bool fundsSufficient = amount <= totalFunds;

        if (!fundsSufficient) {
            revert("Insufficient balance in the contract.");
        } else {
            totalFunds -= amount;
        }
    }

    function getFunds() external view returns (uint256) {
        assert(totalFunds >= 0);
        return totalFunds;
    }
}
