# Auction Smart Contract

## Overview

The Auction smart contract allows users to participate in a simple auction system on the Ethereum blockchain. Participants can place bids, withdraw funds if they are outbid, and the auction owner can finalize the auction and claim the highest bid.

## Features

- **Place Bids:** Users can place bids on the auction with an amount greater than the current highest bid.
- **Withdraw Funds:** Users who are outbid can withdraw their funds.
- **End Auction:** The auction owner can end the auction and transfer the highest bid amount to themselves.
- **Check Bid Amount:** Users can check the bid amount of a specific address.

## Contract Details

### State Variables

- `address public owner`: The address of the auction owner.
- `uint256 public highestBid`: The highest bid placed so far.
- `address public highestBidder`: The address of the current highest bidder.
- `bool public auctionEnded`: Indicates if the auction has ended.
- `mapping(address => uint256) public bids`: Maps addresses to their respective bid amounts.

### Functions

#### `constructor()`
Initializes the contract by setting the deployer as the owner, initializing the highest bid to 0, and marking the auction as not ended.

#### `function placeBid() external payable`
Allows users to place a bid on the auction. Requires the bid to be higher than the current highest bid and ensures the auction is ongoing.

#### `function withdraw() external`
Allows users who are not the highest bidder to withdraw their funds if they are outbid. Resets the user's bid amount before transferring the funds.

#### `function endAuction() external`
Allows the auction owner to end the auction and transfer the highest bid to themselves. Requires that the auction is still ongoing and that there is at least one bid.

#### `function getBidAmount(address bidder) external view returns (uint256)`
Allows users to query the bid amount of a specific address.

## Deployment

1. **Compile the Contract:**
   Use a Solidity compiler compatible with version `^0.8.0`.

2. **Deploy the Contract:**
   Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum blockchain using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

## Usage

1. **Place a Bid:**
   Send a transaction to the `placeBid` function with a value greater than the current highest bid.

2. **Withdraw Funds:**
   If you are outbid, you can call the `withdraw` function to retrieve your funds.

3. **End the Auction:**
   The auction owner can call the `endAuction` function to finalize the auction and claim the highest bid amount.

4. **Check Bid Amount:**
   Use the `getBidAmount` function to check the bid amount for a specific address.

## Security Considerations

- **Reentrancy Attack Prevention:** The `withdraw` function resets the user's bid before transferring funds to avoid reentrancy attacks.
- **Safe Transfer:** The contract uses `call` for transferring funds. Ensure to handle any potential failures or security concerns.
